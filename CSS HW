        <h2>The most important aspect of color in daily life is probably the aesthetic and psychological responses that they
        evoke”our psychological perception”and the resulting influences on art, fashion, commerce, and even physical and
        emotional sensations. For example, reds, oranges, yellows, and browns are warm, whereas blues, greens, and grays are
        cold. Reds, oranges, and yellows are said to induce excitement, cheerfulness, stimulation, and aggression; blues and
        greens to induce security, calm, and peace; and browns, grays, and blacks to bring sadness, depression, and melancholy.
        However, we can only generalize about such subjective perceptions.</h2>
        <h3>Age, mood, mental health, and other factors affect color perception. People sharing distinct personal traits often share
        color perceptions and preferences. For example, schizophrenics are said to have abnormal color perception, and very
        young children learning to distinguish colors usually prefer red or orange. Many psychologists believe that analyzing
        one's use of and response to color reveals relevant physiological and psychological information. Some even suggest that
        specific colors have a therapeutic effect on physical and mental disabilities.</h3>
        <h4>Colors are not universal. Some languages do not have separate words for green and blue or yellow and orange, whereas
        Eskimos use 17 different words for white to describe different snow conditions. Comparing color terminology reveals
        certain consistent patterns. All languages have designations for black and white.
        
        If a third hue is distinguished, it is red; next comes yellow or green, and then other colors.
        
        Consider soccer fanatics who so love their team's colors that they tear and burn the other team's flag. They dye their
        hair and faces yellow-red, blue-white, or red-white to match their team's colors, but cannot stand the opponent's
        colors. They taunt the opposing team with clothes in their own team's colors, even to the extent of injury or death.
        Most important, they gain identity, send a message, and enjoy the confidence that comes with belonging to a peer group.</h4>
